        <h2>Aggregate Points</h2><p/>

        <hr/>
    <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features  and an area. The area can optionally be an input polygon layer, or it can be a grid calculated when the tool is run. The tool first
determines which points fall within each area. After determining
this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all
points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well. 

    </p>
    <p>This tool can also work on data that is time enabled. If time is enabled on the input points, than the tools time slicing options are available. Time slicing allows you to calculate the point-in area relationship while looking at a specific slice in time. For example, you could look at hourly intervals, which would result in outputs for each hour. 
    </p>
    <p>For an example without time, suppose you have point features of coffee shop locations and area features of counties, and you want to summarize coffee sales by county.  Assuming the  coffee shops have a    <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within each county, the minimum or maximum <i>TOTAL_SALES</i>
 within each county, or other statistics like the count, range, standard deviation, and variance.
    </p>
    <p>For an example with time, suppose you had point features of every transaction made at a coffee shop location and no polygon data set. The data has been recorded over a year, and each transaction has a location and a time stamp. Assuming each transaction has a <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL SALES</i> within the space and time of interest. If these transactions are for a single city, we could generate polygons that were one kilometer grids, and look at weekly time slices to summarize the transactions in both time and space.
